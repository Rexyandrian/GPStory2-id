Spectators expressed amazement at how an unknown team could pull off such an impressive performance. They've certainly sparked our interest as well."
"#01557","Newcomer <name> recently took part in their first race--the <0>. They had some trouble at first, and just when it looked like they had gotten their bearings, they had to drop out. The editors here hope they won't let this initial setback get to them. We're rooting for you, <name>!"
"#01558","Newcomer <name> recently took part in their first race--the <0>. Of course, it's too much to expect to win your first race, and in fact they came in toward the rear of the pack. But their refusal to give up showed determination that we liked. The editors here hope they won't let this initial setback get to them. We're rooting for you, <name>!"
"#01559","Newcomer <name> recently took part in their first race--the <0>. They got off to an impressive start, taking their opponents by surprise and coming in first! A spectator commented excitedly that he got chills down his spine as they passed by, and we felt much the same way as we watched. Perhaps this signals the arrival of a new world-class racing team. We'll be watching their next race very closely."
"#01560","We've been getting letters from team owners struggling with their finances, asking for advice, so we interviewed a famously well-off car racing veteran and asked him for the secret to his success.<br>   ""You can't bank on getting enough funds by winning races. To secure a stable source of income for the team, the best way is to have a sponsor. Keep your sponsor happy and they'll even pay you extra, or give you other rewards. It's a really good deal.<br>   And how to make a sponsor happy? Winning races is one way, but not the only one. Having appealing drivers and pit crew works as well. Maybe you could even try hiring a celeb to join your crew, hehe.""<br>   Well, this has been enlightening! Dear readers, we hope this info will end your money troubles once and for all."
"#01561","Breaking news! It has just been officially announced that the newcomer <co=0066cc><name> </co>has entered the <co=0066cc><0></co>!<br>   A quick recap of the rules: the GP is a series of races. Each team is evaluated using a point system after every race, and the one with the highest total number of points after the last race wins the championship. This also qualifies them for even more elite GPs.<br><br>We interviewed a now-retired racing team that won the <0> a number of times.<br>   ""The first time we did every race in the same car, and it was a disaster. It broke down halfway through the championship. So then we tried again with two machines, switching between them, and it went smoothly that time.<br>   The races take place on different circuits, so you gotta make sure the car's suited to the circuit. I think realizing that was what finally enabled us to win.""<br>So this seems to be the winning strategy. What valuable insight!"
"#01562","We've just heard that <name>'s vehicle exploded while competing in the <0>. ""It just wasn't durable enough,"" said the head of the investigatory committee. ""It's important to perform frequent repairs, but this might have been avoided if the vehicle had been more durable."" Since a Grand Prix involves back-to-back races, improving the repair skills of your mechanics is definitely a good choice."
"#01563","<name> has just debuted their second car! One of the many fans on hand to witness the event commented, ""Now the team can stand should-to-shoulder with any of the world-class teams. I wish I could take a ride in it myself!"" We look forward to seeing the new vehicle in action."
"#01564","As this reporter was taking a stroll earlier today, I just happened to see what appeared to be the development of a new vehicle at the <name> garage. One of the mechanics who agreed to talk to me said, ""We're putting all of our know-how into this one. It'll be amazing! Hey, this is off the record, right?"" Oops, I guess I wasn't supposed to publish that, but what's done is done. I can hardly wait to see what they've come up with."
"#01565","Hawaii, what a lovely place to be! Naturally, I'm here not on holiday, but to interview mechanics from a very popular local team.<br>   ""Why I applied to work here? Maaan, it's Hawaii! Beautiful beaches, great weather. If I'm going to spend all my day working, it'd better be in a nice environment, you know what I mean?""<br>   After a little research, it turned out that the crew's productivity greatly increased since moving to this particular team.<br>   It would seem that the environment has a considerable impact on quality of work. Time to plant some flowers by your garage, perhaps?"
"#01566","In today's special feature, we're going to focus on...popularity with fans!<br>   Have you noticed that sometimes teams that perform equally can have a massively different numbers of fans? Why is that, do you think? Our reporters worked tirelessly to find the answer and here it is: it's all about appeal!<br>   Appealing drivers and mechanics make a team stand out from the crowd, earning it more fans. Sponsors love them too, for all the extra hype and attention they generate!"
"#01567","Today we were fortunate enough to get the rare opportunity to interview one of the leading racing teams in the world. We asked them what is the most important to them.<br>   ""It's our fans. We wouldn't be where we are without them. It's amazing when it's your team that all the spectators at a race are cheering for. That's why we work hard to get as many fans as possible. They even sometimes send us very valuable gifts, for which we are so grateful.""<br>  It may be worth entering a race over and over again just to get more fans!"

"#02198","Dear <name>."
,"I'm your local egg seller."
,"I thought, what better way is there to promote my fresh produce than by organizing a car race?"

"#02199","Oops, having a second job Isn't allowed? I guess I'll forget about this idea then!"
"#02200","Nitro is highly flammable. Injecting it into the engine lets you accelerate very fast in a short burst."

,"We should exchange the tires, or pick another vehicle instead."
"#02211","Hey, it was good race, wasn't it?"
,"Your team came #<0>. Here's your prize."
"#02212","Good luck in your next race!"
"#02213","Great, we got some grain!"
,"If we feed grain to chickens, they'll lay eggs which we can use to enhance our vehicles."

,"Try reorganizing your items, or purchase a Warehouse upgrade to make it bigger."
"#02220","<call>, the <co=0070c0><0> </co>we developed is slightly damaged."
,"We'd better get it fixed before using it in a race."
"#02221","I can hardly believe it! Winning <co=0070c0><0></co> in such style!"
,"<co=0070c0><name></co>, you've made your mark on the history of motorsports."

,"Let me see... Oh yes... This goes here... There, done."
"#02225","I've got to be off now. If you don't mind, I'd love to lend you a hand next time I happen to be nearby."
"#02226","Helloes, it's me, Dr. Mochipon."
,"I'm always out and about these days. Anyway, your team is working on dismantling another vehicle, hmm?"
,"Allow me to help! Hand me the spanner... All right, this should do it... Aaand done!"
"#02227","I think I've done enough walking and jogging. If I keep it up, I may get too thin and scrawny, haha."
,"So anyway, you probably won't be seeming me much anymore. Don't miss me!"
,"Maybe we'll meet again some time."
"#02228","So we meet again."
,"I've eaten too many donuts again and could use some exercise. So hand me a spanner and let me help!"
"#02229","Got to go now. See you again some time!"
"#02230","Howdy! I'm doing promotions in this area."
